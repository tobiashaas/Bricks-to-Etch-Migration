## Next Steps

1. Re-run `vendor/bin/phpcs --standard=phpcs.xml.dist` to confirm continued compliance.
2. If violations are reported, address them manually or rerun `scripts/run-phpcbf.sh` for automatic fixes.
3. Regenerate the manual backlog via [`scripts/analyze-phpcs-violations.sh`](../scripts/analyze-phpcs-violations.sh) to capture outstanding manual work.
4. Update this report with statistics from each subsequent PHPCBF run.
