= Frequently Asked Questions =

= Does this plugin work with all Bricks Builder versions? =

Yes, the plugin is designed to work with all versions of Bricks Builder that store content in the `_bricks_page_content_2` meta field.

= What happens to Bricks-specific elements like sliders? =

Bricks-specific elements (sliders, accordions, etc.) are converted to their HTML/CSS representation. You'll need to recreate these elements manually in Etch using Etch's native components.

= Can I migrate custom fields from ACF to MetaBox? =

Yes, the plugin supports cross-plugin migration. ACF fields can be migrated to MetaBox and vice versa, though some field types may require manual adjustment.

= Is the migration reversible? =

No, this is a one-way migration. Always backup your site before starting the migration process.

= How long does the migration take? =

Migration time depends on the size of your site. Small sites (1-10 pages) typically take 1-5 minutes, while large sites (100+ pages) may take 30+ minutes.

= What if the migration fails? =

The plugin includes comprehensive error handling and logging. Check the migration logs for specific error codes and solutions. You can resume the migration from where it left off.
